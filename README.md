# Furever Pets


## Team: Shane Dinh, Zee Virola, Farhan Abdullahi', Larry Sorto, Gabriel Wagner

## Description:
Our group wanted to use the skills and knowledge we’ve acquired in this bootcamp so far to create something pertaining to a subject we’re all passionate about: for us, that was animals. There are so many people looking for a new fur baby, and fur babies looking for new parents. We wanted to provide a simple way to help narrow down anybody’s search by certain criteria you provide. Take our quiz and find an adoption match. If you’re not satisfied with the match, take it again, or use the suggestion to help guide your search.

## User Story

**AS** a potential pet parent
I **WANT** an application that helps me find my desired pet
**SO THAT** when I search for a pet, my results are filtered to my specifications

Given a desired cat or dog; when I choose my preferences; then I expect an array or pet results.
